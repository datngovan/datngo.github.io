		    					<h2>Reasons</h2>
		    					
		    					<p>I'm interested in the web development area of IT. Back in 2017, I have no ideas about what I am going to do when I finish high school. I didn't decide to apply the document to any university yet, and I watch a Vlog of a Vietnamese senior web developer. After watching several of his videos I found some, I discovered that my strengths fit into this area: teamwork, working with computers, solving logical problems. Therefore, I have taken several online courses on the Internet, for example, HTML and Python beginner course on Codecademy. I am a student at the School of Information Technology at RMIT University recently.</p>

		    					<h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
		    					<p>There are several reasons to explain why I chose RMIT. Firstly, RMIT can create a fully multinational environment. To define, RMIT's students use English as a language to study and communicate. They prepare for their future career path when they have to do an IT job they have to speak English as well as reading documents written in English. Secondly, Visa and finance is a serious issue when you study abroad. You have to spend much more money than you expect to rent a house or on subsistence. At RMIT, I can stay in my country, and I think it much more confident for me. </p>

		    					<h2>What I expect to learn at RMIT</h2>
		    				
		    					<p>When I study at RMIT, learning technical things is not the primary care. I want to learn how to work in a group as well as problem-solving and minimal solutions. At RMIT, I have to do 1 group project at least each subject, which helps students develop their teamwork skills, leadership, and management skills. Those skills will be helpful for their future careers, especially IT-related jobs. Moreover, I want to my thinking. For example, how to solve a problem effectively and get to the optimal solution in time.

		    					<h2>Web Developer (Back-end)</h2>
		    					
		    					<p>

I want to apply for a junior Back-end web developer position. When I was young, my parents have rented a team to make a website for my family business. Then I found that how a website can attract customers and help my family business. Moreover, I prefer a job that required a lot of different skills. A web developer have to require many different skills. For example, I must have technical knowledge about HTML, CSS and API and I also analyst customers data to develop the website and applications better. Lastly, I can learn a lot of new things from my colleagues and seniors as a junior developer.

This job required an understanding of back-end developer tools such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Rest API, AJAX and MVC. Also, Enthusiasm for web development and learning new programming languages and technologies is a compulsory requirement. Furthermore, applicants have to speak English comfortably as well as good teamwork.  

I am currently studying basic HTML , SCC by myself and I am very confident about communicating in English. Moreover, I have a big enthusiasm of developing website and learning from other people that can be a plus.

		    					<h2>16Personalities Test</h2>
		    					<p>The result of the 16Personalities Test shows that I have a Consul personality. Consul persons can quickly adapt to any situation, for example, forming a team. In an organization, Consul is well-organized and will bring the structure and order into the group. People with Consul personalities are comfortable with listening to people and help them. As teammates, other people rarely get angry with Consul. When my partners and I form a team, I usually in the leader position because I will call my teammates in a meeting and individuals to find out what are their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, my partners take part in the project that they feel comfortable. Moreover, I am the middle-man when my partner has some arguments. I make sure those arguments can be controlled and do not impact the team's productivity.

For example, when I study programming, I'd like to run a few code lines of a great program to see what those codes can do so I can learn directly from that. When I work in a team, I will avoid the distraction in working and study time. However, I will represent my work more visually in a team meeting. Therefore, my partners can quickly know what will exactly happen.</p>

		    					<h2>Summary:</h2>
		    					<p>My project is a chatbox for Foody platforms. That will release some messages automatically when the drivers accept the offers of customers (like Grab and GoViet). This chatbox shows the status of the request, such as, "The drivers arrive at the restaurant."That is similar to another chatbox we use that have two people connect in a chatbox to communicate directly.

		    					<h2>Motivation:</h2>
		    					<p>Foody is the very first company that gets into the food delivery area. However, the Foody app doesn't have a good chatbox. Customers have to chat with support service staff first. That leads to a distraction when the information comes to the drivers. I am used to a Foody user because of Foody chat box is very terrible. You have to text and wait for the staff's answer. Then the information will be sent to the driver's phone. Those things lead to the increase in delivery time compared with their competitive platforms: Grab and Goviet.

					    	</div>
					    	<div class="text pl-3">
		    			
		    					<h2>Description:</h2>
		    					<p>There are three primary functions that this chatbox will have. First of all, I will reduce the role of the support service staff position in the chatbox because it is a waste of time and productivity. Instead of that, I will allow customers to change their address if wrong and add the delivery after. This new chatbox will help Foody to cut off a lot of unnecessary employees and reduce the delivery cost.</p>

<p>Secondly, I will add chatbots that help customers to change the address as well as answer the FAQ questions. If the chat box cannot help, they can chat directly with the support services staff. Which allows customers to have more control with the system. Because we don't want to talk will a team when we do not need help. The FAQ is used to make analysts about customers' behavior individually. Therefore, Foody can use that to specialize in what types of food customers prefer. Moreover, the chatbot can work 24/7.</p>

<p>Finally, adding the call button. That allows customers and drivers to contact each other via phone numbers previously registered. This function is beneficial for drivers who want to confirm the request directly and contact if problems such as: out of stock, restaurants closed, and price changes. For customers, they can instruct the driver or be notified when the dish arrives directly.</p>

<p>However, there are some drawbacks to this chatbox. The following paragraphs will point out those problems and how can we solve them.
Firstly, the chatbots maybe not effective immediately due to the undeveloped. However, we can fix it automatically by collecting customers using behavior, for example, adding more FQAs by popular answer questions recently.</p>

<p>Secondly, the support service staff number is reducing while chatbot develops. But we still need some support service staff. Because people sometimes struggle with apps, and they need some live chat. I call it "al Time Convenience to Customers" "which will provide the customers' believe that they can have help whenever they want. So a support service staff available in working hours is necessary.

		    					<h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
		    					<p>To create a chatbox, I need to use  APN (Apple Push Notification Service) - when dealing with Apple devices and Google Cloud Messaging Service – when dealing with Android devices to push the notification on the screen as well as sent messages. I have to create a chatbot use DialogFlow and offers integration with Google Assistant, Facebook, Telegrame. Also, I will create a backend app for the bot using Node.js able to handle user requests and actions of customers.

					    	</div>
					    	<div class="text pl-3">
		    			
		    					<h2>Skills Required:</h2>
		    					<p>I will code software for the call button by using Python. Create a Node.js back-end app to handle customer requests. Also, I will use Google Assistant to develop AI chatterbot by adding more popular FAQs, and a physical server has to be installed because the AI chatterbot and chatbox have to process a large amount of data

					    	<div class="text pl-3">
		    			
		    					<h2>Outcome:</h2>
		    					<p>The original chatbox of Foody is a chatbox for at least three people: customer, support service staff and driver. The support service staff confirm the offers and ask customers if the address is right. However, if the wrong address customer cannot change by themselves, they have to send a request to the staff. This process is too cumbersome. It makes customers and drivers passive, leading to an extension of delivery time, usually about 30 minutes longer than Grab as well as the increase in delivery price. If this project is applied, the process will be significantly reduced. Foody does not need to hire too many collaborators for support work and focus on branding, discounts to counter other platforms.
